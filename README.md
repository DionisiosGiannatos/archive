# Scripts Archive
An archive containing all MATLAB/Octave scripts used in university projects.
Mostly includes general numerical methods (Newton-Raphson, Gradient Descent, etc.) and specific project applications, such as systems of equations meant to be solved with fsolve, or linear regressions.

Scripts are categorized by the class they were used for, hence the folders being named after the classes.
